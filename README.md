✅ Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
This program takes an integer input from the user and uses an if-else statement to check if the number is divisible by 2. If it is, it's even; otherwise, it's odd.

✅ Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50
This program uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to 50 and calculates the total sum of all numbers in that range. The final result is displayed at the end.
